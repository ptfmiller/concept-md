### Dynamic app is a game changing vision of a customer acquisition experience

|* Predict & present the most relevant offers             |* Process information iteratively, in real time          |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|* Very short form for those we know (existing customers) |* Adaptive UI to collect more information where necessary|
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|* Frictionless information collection (Auto-fill etc.)   |* Multi-product underwriting enables counter-offers      |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|* Real time error handling                               |* Difficult to reverse engineer                          |

### Given the unique governance challenges we want to adopt a set of guiding principles on how we govern this program

|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
|                  Governance Challenges                  |                    Guiding Principles                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|1. Rapid testing and improvement enabled by the digital set-up 
2. Agile mode of operation - demands expeditious decision making with iterative product development
3. Documentation risk - too little or too much documentation given the large quantum of testing and nature of product delivery 
4. Risk of missing the forest for the trees - Excessive focus on improvements on the margin with the risk of losing the overall program piture 
|1. Enable expeditious decision making congruent with agile:
    * Product Managers delegated to make decisions on less impactful credit decisions
    * Demos and sprint planning sessions used forreviewing decisions and results
2. Transparency in decision making with decoumentation sloped with risk:
    * Log all decisions (incluing small tests) in a decision log - see sample later
    * CO / CGA judgment on level of documentation needed
3. Obsessive focus on monitoring and escalation to avoid missing forest for trees:
    * Detailed monitoring set-up with differing levels of granulatrity to monitor overall program performance and individual changes
    * Clear escalation plans and kill switches
4. Flexibility in governance process to account for unknown-unknowns:
    * In consultation with CRM, use program addendum or other means to adapt and document unique governance needs as they emerge |
|_________________________________________________________X_________________________________________________________|
|                       Decision tracking and monitoring is critical to success of rapid testing                    |

### The proposed approach is largely consistent across consumer segments and includes a manual review treatment for SB

|================|===============|===============|
|Upmarket        |Mainstreet     |Small Business |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
|* Closes NPV+ segments
* Layers on judgment to close accts with 3+ returns and >100% utilization
|* Closes NPV+ segments
* Except for NSF returns where judgmental threshold is 3+ returns and >*120%* utilization
|* The Uniqueness of SB warrants a more nuanced approach
* Auto close where chargeoff >50%; agents review where >35% |

### In the coming year, we will focus on strategic growth and tailoring our strategies to meet customer needs
|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
|     Current State           |         Destination         |
|========================== ->|=============================|
|  Simple, Aggregate Programs |Tailored, Competitive Programs|
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| *Policies attempt to serve multiple subpopulations but fail to address unique needs* | *Policies tailored to meet customers' needs in a competitive marketplace* |
|========================== ->|=============================|
|   Stagnant Policies         |Innovative, Resilient Growth |
| *Static policies with limited innovation* | *Expansive, resilient policies that capture full program value and enhance portfolio optics* |

### During the 2016 program cycle, we will integrate a new customer segmentation framework to better target and meet customer needs

|===========|===========|===========|==========|
|Heavy Spenders|Transactors|Short-Term Borrowers|Revolvers|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| *Robust cash flow, always pays in full*| *Modest cash flow, always pays in full* | *Healthy business that uses card as a cash management and lending tool* | *Consistently carries and revolves a balance* |
